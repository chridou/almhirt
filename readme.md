## What is Almhirt?

Almhirt aims to be an application toolkit. 
It's goal is to help building immutable domain models, avoid exceptional code paths and using a message driven design.
Furthermore Almhirt will support event sourcing.

## What's the motivation?

Dive into scala and build something that might be useful. 

## Is this all new?

No. Inspiration was taken from
* [Towards an immutable domain model(Erik Rozendaal)](http://blog.zilverline.com/2011/02/01/towards-an-immutable-domain-model-introduction-part-1/)
* [Building an Event-Sourced Web Application(Martin Krasser)](http://krasserm.blogspot.de/2011/11/building-event-sourced-web-application.html)
* [BlueEyes(Concurrency)](http://noelwelsh.com/blueeyes/concurrency.html)
